  "The existence of culture is based on the relationships between people. However, it is essential to note that the practices and beliefs that define a culture are passed down from one generation to another. Aspects of culture from a traditional perspective are the most documented, but little is documented and studied on culture from the digital age perspective. Technology is a significant force in the world and heavily dictates what happens in the present as it is used both as the primary and supporting component to humanity.",
  "Jazz is one of the original American art forms that flourished around 1900 in New Orleans, Louisiana. New Orleans is a gateway between the United States and the Caribbean, with a hierarchical population and a strong French colonial remnant culture that encourages the formation of a mixed musical culture that is invisible in any other city in the United States. Jazz music has become an important part of the American culture.",
  "Trees contribute to a rich healthy ecosystem. Animals, insects, birds, and fungi make their home in the trees and make a diverse ecosystem. This balanced environment, in turn, contributes to the betterment of human beings. Trees produce their own food and are found at the bottom of the food chain. They produce their own food through a process called photosynthesis and contribute significantly to the whole ecosystem.",
  "There are so many precious things that we are interested in in daily life and friendship is also no exception. It can be considered the most valuable thing that anyone can have in their life. Living life without having the experience of friendship is like living without a soul. Human interaction is essential for survival in our society, but developing friendships is crucial to the success of any person.",
  "Time management is the discipline of controlling your life through your use of the 168 hours that are available to you weekly. In mastering time management, you'll be able to balance the demands on your time and achieve your goals. This will then help you to avoid stress and increase your level of productivity.",
  "The Italian Renaissance, lasting from the 14th to the 17th centuries, and the Romantic era of the late 18th and early 19th centuries were influential both in art and literature. The Italian Renaissance saw a notable revival of the classical values of ancient Greece and Rome. Having the ability to rely on political stability and growing prosperity in Italy, the people allowed for the development of new technologies - including the printing press, a new system of astronomy, and with that, came philosophy, literature, and art.",
  "Imagine a day where you wake up in the morning to your alarm, the lights throughout your home slowly brighten and the coffee pot starts brewing a cup before you even finish stretching, your mirror displays the time and weather forecast for you, and as you walk out the door, the lights turn off, the thermostat lowers its temperature, and all doors lock behind you. That thought may seem far into the future, but with home and lifestyle automation through IoT devices, it could easily become reality very soon.",
  "Knowledge is one of the most basic categories that people use to perceive the world around them. It forms the basis of how people act and which decisions they make at every point of their life. However, the philosophical concept of knowledge is anything but simple because there is always the question of how people can know that they know something. While empiricism, idealism, and rationalism all present their potential answers, there is no definite way to disprove hard skepticism - and, moreover, there may be no practical need to.",
