  "The aim of the current study is concerned with contextualizing and recovering the politics behind the creation of punk fanzines, or magazines, produced in the 1970s in the United Kingdom. Magazines, and the youth culture in general, aimed to provide a context for the young people within a culture to express their opinions, ideas, and anxieties about the sociopolitical climate. The fanzines could be used as historical portals into different periods of socioeconomic, political, and cultural developments. With the emergence of the punk movement, which was heavily ignored by the mainstream media, fanzines became essential forms of cultural communication among young people who aimed to challenge the established social norms.",

Technology is a significant force in the world and heavily dictates what happens in the present as it is used both as the primary and supporting component to humanity. With the rise of technology as an integral component to people, it is important to explore elements of culture and society and the changes brought to them by present-day technology.",

Jazz music become an important part of the American culture.",
